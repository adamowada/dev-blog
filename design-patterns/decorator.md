 Pattern Name: Decorator

Problem: The Decorator pattern addresses the problem of extending or modifying the behavior of an object without modifying its structure or subclassing it. This is particularly useful when you want to add new functionality to an object without affecting other instances of the same class.

Solution: The Decorator pattern involves wrapping an existing object with a new object that has the same interface. The new object (decorator) can then add or override the behavior of the original object (decoratee) while still maintaining the original object's core functionality.

Consequences:

Benefits:

Provides a flexible way to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its implementation.
Promotes code reusability, as decorators can be applied to multiple classes.
Allows for multiple decorators to be applied to a single object, enabling a customizable combination of behaviors.
Drawbacks:

Can introduce complexity, especially when multiple decorators are involved.
May lead to a larger number of smaller classes, which can be harder to understand and manage.
Implementation: In Python, decorators can be implemented using classes or functions. Here's an example using classes:

```python
class Component:
    def operation(self):
        pass

class ConcreteComponent(Component):
    def operation(self):
        return "ConcreteComponent"

class Decorator(Component):
    def __init__(self, component):
        self._component = component

    def operation(self):
        return self._component.operation()

class ConcreteDecoratorA(Decorator):
    def operation(self):
        return f"ConcreteDecoratorA({self._component.operation()})"
        
```

Participants:

Component: An abstract class or interface that defines the common interface for both the concrete components and decorators.
ConcreteComponent: The class that implements the Component interface, providing the core functionality to be decorated.
Decorator: An abstract class that implements the Component interface and has a reference to a Component object.
ConcreteDecorator: The class that extends the Decorator class and is responsible for adding or modifying the behavior of the wrapped Component.
Collaborations:

Concrete decorators wrap concrete components or other decorators, effectively chaining them together.
When the operation() method is called on a concrete decorator, it executes its own behavior and calls the operation() method of the wrapped component (which may be another decorator or the concrete component).
Real-world examples:

The Decorator pattern is commonly used in GUI toolkits to add visual effects or additional behavior to UI components.
The Python standard library uses the Decorator pattern in the I/O module, where io.BufferedIOBase and io.TextIOBase provide buffering to other file-like objects.
In web development, decorators can be used to apply authorization, logging, or caching to specific routes or endpoints.
