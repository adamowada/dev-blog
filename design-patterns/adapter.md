Pattern Name: Adapter

Problem: The Adapter pattern addresses the issue of incompatibility between two existing interfaces. In a system, there may be components with different interfaces that need to work together, but cannot directly interact due to differences in their interfaces.

Solution: The Adapter pattern introduces an additional class, the Adapter, which acts as a bridge between the incompatible interfaces. The Adapter implements the target interface (the one the client expects) and translates calls from that interface to the existing incompatible interface, making it possible for the two components to interact seamlessly.

Consequences:

Benefits:
Increases reusability by allowing existing components to be used with new or different interfaces.
Improves flexibility by decoupling the client from the implementation of the adapted class.
Drawbacks:
Introduces an extra layer of indirection, which may impact performance.
May increase complexity, as additional classes are added to the system.
Implementation: Here's an example of implementing the Adapter pattern in Python:

```python
class TargetInterface:
    def request(self) -> str:
        pass

class Adaptee:
    def specific_request(self) -> str:
        return "Adaptee's specific request"

class Adapter(TargetInterface):
    def __init__(self, adaptee: Adaptee) -> None:
        self.adaptee = adaptee

    def request(self) -> str:
        return self.adaptee.specific_request()

def client_code(target: TargetInterface) -> None:
    print(target.request(), end="")

adaptee = Adaptee()
adapter = Adapter(adaptee)
client_code(adapter)

```

Participants:

TargetInterface: Defines the interface that the client expects and interacts with.
Adaptee: Represents the existing component with an incompatible interface.
Adapter: Implements the TargetInterface and wraps the Adaptee, translating calls from the target interface to the Adaptee's specific interface.
Collaborations: The client interacts with the TargetInterface, which in this case is implemented by the Adapter. The Adapter translates calls from the TargetInterface to the Adaptee's interface, allowing the client to interact with the Adaptee indirectly.

Real-world examples: A common example of the Adapter pattern in action is using third-party libraries or APIs with incompatible interfaces. By creating an adapter, developers can integrate these libraries without modifying the library or API code, ensuring compatibility and allowing for seamless integration.
