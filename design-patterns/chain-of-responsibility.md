1. Pattern Name: Chain of Responsibility

2. Problem: A request needs to be processed by a series of handlers or processors, but the specific handler or the sequence of handlers is not predetermined. The goal is to decouple the sender of the request from the receiver, allowing multiple handlers to process the request or even to stop the processing at any point.

3. Solution: The Chain of Responsibility pattern involves creating a chain of handler objects where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it along to the next handler in the chain. The sender of the request is unaware of which handler processes the request, and new handlers can be added or removed without modifying the sender.

4. Consequences:
   - Benefits:
     - Decouples the sender and receiver of the request.
     - Enhances flexibility as new handlers can be added easily.
     - Allows handlers to be reusable and interchangeable.
   - Drawbacks:
     - May lead to increased processing time if the chain is long.
     - The request may not be handled if no suitable handler is found in the chain.

5. Implementation: Implement the pattern in Python by creating an abstract handler class and concrete handler classes. Each concrete handler should be responsible for processing the request or passing it to the next handler.

6. Participants:
   - Handler (AbstractHandler): An abstract class that defines the interface for handling requests and maintaining the reference to the next handler in the chain.
   - ConcreteHandler: Concrete classes that implement the Handler interface, process the request, or delegate it to the next handler.

7. Collaborations: The sender sends a request to the first handler in the chain. Each handler in the chain either processes the request or passes it to the next handler, until a suitable handler is found or the request reaches the end of the chain.

8. Real-world examples: The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be found in various applications, such as event handling systems, logging frameworks, or middleware in web servers.

Example code:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractHandler(ABC):

    def __init__(self, next_handler=None):
        self._next_handler = next_handler

    def set_next(self, next_handler):
        self._next_handler = next_handler
        return next_handler

    @abstractmethod
    def handle_request(self, request):
        pass

    def _handle_next(self, request):
        if self._next_handler is not None:
            return self._next_handler.handle_request(request)

class ConcreteHandlerA(AbstractHandler):

    def handle_request(self, request):
        if request < 10:
            return f"Handler A: Processed request {request}"
        return self._handle_next(request)

class ConcreteHandlerB(AbstractHandler):

    def handle_request(self, request):
        if request >= 10 and request < 20:
            return f"Handler B: Processed request {request}"
        return self._handle_next(request)

# Client code
handlerA = ConcreteHandlerA()
handlerB = ConcreteHandlerB()

handlerA.set_next(handlerB)

requests = [5, 12, 25]

for req in requests:
    print(handlerA.handle_request(req))

```
