Pattern Name: Template Method

Problem: The Template Method design pattern addresses situations where you have a series of steps in an algorithm that are executed in a specific order, and some of these steps may have multiple implementations. The goal is to define a common structure for the algorithm while allowing subclasses to override or extend specific steps without altering the overall structure.

Solution: The Template Method pattern suggests defining an abstract base class that encapsulates the algorithm's structure in a method, often referred to as the "template method." This method consists of a series of calls to abstract or concrete methods representing the individual steps of the algorithm. Concrete subclasses can then override these methods to provide their own implementations for specific steps without modifying the template method itself.

Consequences:

Benefits:
Encourages code reuse and modularity.
Simplifies the maintenance and extension of the algorithm.
Enforces a consistent structure for the algorithm across different implementations.
Drawbacks:
The pattern might be overkill for simple cases or when the algorithm's structure is unlikely to change.
In some situations, it may lead to unnecessary complexity or many small methods in subclasses.
Implementation: In Python, you can use inheritance and method overriding to implement the Template Method pattern. Here's an example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Algorithm(ABC):
    def template_method(self):
        self.step_one()
        self.step_two()
        self.step_three()

    def step_one(self):
        print("Step 1: Common implementation.")

    @abstractmethod
    def step_two(self):
        pass

    def step_three(self):
        print("Step 3: Common implementation.")

class ConcreteAlgorithmA(Algorithm):
    def step_two(self):
        print("Step 2: ConcreteAlgorithmA implementation.")

class ConcreteAlgorithmB(Algorithm):
    def step_two(self):
        print("Step 2: ConcreteAlgorithmB implementation.")

# Usage
algorithm_a = ConcreteAlgorithmA()
algorithm_a.template_method()

algorithm_b = ConcreteAlgorithmB()
algorithm_b.template_method()

```

Participants:

AbstractClass (Algorithm): An abstract class defining the template method and the abstract or concrete methods representing the algorithm's steps.
ConcreteClass (ConcreteAlgorithmA, ConcreteAlgorithmB): Concrete subclasses that provide their own implementations for the abstract methods defined in the AbstractClass.
Collaborations: The ConcreteClass instances use the template method defined in the AbstractClass, and the AbstractClass calls the concrete or abstract methods defined in the ConcreteClass to execute the steps of the algorithm.

Real-world examples: The Template Method pattern is commonly used in frameworks, libraries, and applications that require consistent execution of algorithms with varying implementations. Examples include data processing pipelines, machine learning training loops, and web application request handling.
