Pattern Name: Strategy

Problem: The Strategy pattern addresses the problem of selecting an algorithm or behavior at runtime, allowing you to switch between different implementations of the same functionality. This pattern is useful when you have multiple ways to perform a specific task, and you want to choose the appropriate method dynamically without changing the client code.

Solution: The Strategy pattern involves defining a family of interchangeable algorithms or behaviors, encapsulating each one in a separate class, and making them interchangeable by using a common interface. This approach allows the client to choose the desired behavior at runtime by selecting the appropriate strategy object.

Consequences:
Benefits:

Increased flexibility by allowing easy switching between different behaviors at runtime.
Enhanced maintainability, as adding or modifying algorithms doesn't require changes to the client code.
Improved separation of concerns by encapsulating each algorithm's implementation in its own class.
Drawbacks:

May introduce additional complexity, especially if there are only a few simple algorithms.
Can lead to an increased number of classes, which might make the code harder to understand for newcomers.
Implementation: Here's a simple example of the Strategy pattern in Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Define the Strategy interface
class SortingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sort(self, data):
        pass

# Implement concrete strategies
class QuickSortStrategy(SortingStrategy):
    def sort(self, data):
        # Perform quick sort
        pass

class MergeSortStrategy(SortingStrategy):
    def sort(self, data):
        # Perform merge sort
        pass

class Context:
    def __init__(self, strategy: SortingStrategy):
        self._strategy = strategy

    def set_strategy(self, strategy: SortingStrategy):
        self._strategy = strategy

    def execute_sort(self, data):
        return self._strategy.sort(data)

# Client code
data = [5, 2, 1, 8, 3]

context = Context(QuickSortStrategy())
context.execute_sort(data)

context.set_strategy(MergeSortStrategy())
context.execute_sort(data)

```

Participants:

Strategy (SortingStrategy): The interface common to all strategies.
Concrete Strategies (QuickSortStrategy, MergeSortStrategy): Classes implementing the Strategy interface, each providing a different algorithm.
Context: A class that uses the Strategy interface to delegate the task to a concrete strategy.
Collaborations: The Context class collaborates with the Strategy interface to execute the desired algorithm. The client code sets the concrete strategy on the Context object, which then delegates the task to the selected strategy implementation.

Real-world examples: The Strategy pattern is commonly used in scenarios where different behaviors or algorithms are required based on specific conditions, such as:

Different sorting algorithms in a sorting utility.
Different compression algorithms in a file compression utility.
Different rendering algorithms in a graphics rendering library.
