1. Pattern Name: Proxy

2. Problem: The need to control access to an object, add a layer of indirection, or postpone object creation for performance or resource optimization purposes.

3. Solution: The Proxy pattern introduces a surrogate object that acts as an intermediary between the client and the target object. The proxy object can handle requests and forward them to the target object when necessary, allowing for additional functionality, such as access control, caching, or lazy loading, to be added without modifying the target object's code.

4. Consequences:
   - Benefits: 
       - Provides a level of abstraction between the client and the target object.
       - Allows for additional functionality to be added without changing the target object's code.
       - Can improve performance and resource usage in certain scenarios.
   - Drawbacks:
       - Introduces an additional level of indirection, which may add complexity.
       - May impact performance if not implemented carefully.

5. Implementation: Implementing the Proxy pattern in Python involves creating a proxy class that implements the same interface as the target object and a reference to the target object. The proxy class handles client requests, performs any necessary actions, and forwards the request to the target object when appropriate.

6. Participants:
   - Subject (interface): An interface that defines the common methods for both the RealSubject and the Proxy classes.
   - RealSubject: The actual object that the Proxy represents and forwards requests to.
   - Proxy: The surrogate object that controls access to and interacts with the RealSubject.

7. Collaborations: The client interacts with the Proxy object instead of the RealSubject. The Proxy object processes the request, applies any additional functionality, and forwards the request to the RealSubject when necessary.

8. Real-world examples: The Proxy pattern can be used in various scenarios, such as:
   - Remote Proxy: Representing a remote object as if it were local.
   - Virtual Proxy: Lazy loading of large objects or expensive resources.
   - Protective Proxy: Controlling access to sensitive objects or actions.

Example Python code:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Subject(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def request(self):
        pass

class RealSubject(Subject):
    def request(self):
        return "RealSubject: Handling request."

class Proxy(Subject):
    def __init__(self, real_subject: RealSubject):
        self._real_subject = real_subject

    def request(self):
        if self.check_access():
            response = self._real_subject.request()
            self.log_access()
            return f"Proxy: {response}"

    def check_access(self) -> bool:
        print("Proxy: Checking access prior to firing a real request.")
        return True

    def log_access(self) -> None:
        print("Proxy: Logging the time of request.", end="\n\n")

def client_code(subject: Subject) -> None:
    print(subject.request(), end="")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    real_subject = RealSubject()
    client_code(real_subject)

    proxy = Proxy(real_subject)
    client_code(proxy)

```
